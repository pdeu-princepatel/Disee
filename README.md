A high-performance, containerized, distributed search engine built with **FastAPI** and **Docker**. This project implements a scalable architecture for dynamically fetching results from external sources (Wikipedia, StackOverflow), partitioning the data into chunks, and distributing them across multiple worker nodes for parallel processing and aggregation.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The project is structured around a **Gateway-Worker** pattern. The central Gateway fetches real-time data from external APIs (Wikipedia, StackOverflow), partitions the content, and distributes it to multiple worker nodes that process and attribute the data in parallel.

### Phase 1: Single Node (Single Machine)
Initial implementation focused on a standalone node managing its own inverted index and search logic.

### Phase 2: Multiple Nodes (Single Machine)
Introduction of the **Gateway Service**, which orchestrates search queries across multiple containers running on the same host via Docker Compose.

### Phase 3: Distributed Cluster (Ongoing 🚀)
The goal of Phase 3 is to achieve full distribution across multiple physical or virtual machines, implementing more resilient discovery and load balancing.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Distributed Query Aggregation**: The Gateway service fans out processed data chunks to all active worker nodes in parallel.
- **Dynamic Multi-Source Integration**: Real-time fetching from Wikipedia and StackOverflow APIs for up-to-date information.
- **Distributed Result Processing**: Nodes act as distributed processors, enriching and attributing dynamic content chunks.
- **Premium Minimal UI**: A Google-inspired, immersive frontend with smooth motion design, focus-aware dimming, and elegant typography.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Heavy use of `httpx` and `asyncio` for non-blocking concurrent node communication.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Fully containerized setup for consistent development and deployment.
- **FastAPI OpenAPI Integration**: Interactive API documentation available out-of-the-box.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for local development, optional).

### Quick Launch

1.  **Clone/Fork the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnshMNSoni/Distributive-Search-Engine.git
    cd Distributive-Search-Engine
    ```

2.  **Spin up the Cluster**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3.  **Access the Search API**:
    - **Gateway Search**: `http://localhost:8000/search?q=your_keyword`
    - **Interactive API Docs (Swagger UI)**: `http://localhost:8000/docs/`

4. **UI Experience**:
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
