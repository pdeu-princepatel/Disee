A high-performance, containerized, distributed search engine built with **FastAPI** and **Docker**. This project implements a scalable architecture for dynamically fetching results from external sources (Wikipedia, StackOverflow), partitioning the data into chunks, and distributing them across multiple worker nodes for parallel processing and aggregation.

## System Architecture

The project is structured around a **Gateway-Worker** pattern. The central Gateway fetches real-time data from external APIs (Wikipedia, StackOverflow), partitions the content, and distributes it to multiple worker nodes that process and attribute the data in parallel.

### Phase 1: Single Node (Single Machine)
Initial implementation focused on a standalone node managing its own inverted index and search logic.

### Phase 2: Multiple Nodes (Single Machine)
Introduction of the **Gateway Service**, which orchestrates search queries across multiple containers running on the same host via Docker Compose.

### Phase 3: Static Nodes (Multiple Machine) (Currently 3 static nodes)
### Phase 3: Static Nodes (Multiple Machine) (Currently 3 static nodes)
The goal of Phase 3 is to achieve full distribution across multiple physical or virtual machines, implementing more resilient discovery and load balancing.

## Key Features & Optimizations

### 1. Dual-Stream Tokenization (Code vs. Prose)
* **Files**: `index_services.py`
* **Mechanism**: During startup document indexing, text content is concurrently tokenized into two distinct streams:
  | Stream | Tokenizer | Behavior | Example |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **Prose** | `tokenize_prose()` | Extracts clean alpha-numeric terms, discarding common stop words (`the`, `is`, `at`, etc.) | `"python scripting"` → `["python", "scripting"]` |
  | **Code** | `tokenize_code()` | Retains programming syntax characters like underscores, dots, and hyphens | `"user_id str.replace"` → `["user_id", "str.replace"]` |
* **Advantage**: Standard prose tokenizers split code elements like `ctx.execute()` into generic `ctx` and `execute` tokens, losing technical context. Keeping syntax structures intact ensures precise search matching on exact API references and variable names.

### 2. Metadata-Weighted Scoring (Social Boost)
* **Files**: `search_services.py`, `index_services.py`
* **Mechanism**: Documents are enriched with interactive metadata (such as upvote and edit counts). Results are ranked dynamically based on this logarithmic scoring system:
  $$\text{final\_score} = \text{text\_match\_score} \times \left(1 + \frac{\text{score}}{100 + \text{score}}\right)$$
* **Advantage**: This ensures highly upvoted/established answers receive a logarithmic authority boost over low-quality matches, prioritizing proven solutions without letting authority overshadow query relevance.
  * *5 upvotes* $\rightarrow$ ~5% boost
  * *100 upvotes* $\rightarrow$ ~50% boost
  * *10,000 upvotes* $\rightarrow$ ~99% boost (caps gracefully)

### 3. Source-Aware Search Modes
* **Files**: `gateway/main.py`, [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/Prince%20Patel/Desktop/Projects/Disee/Disee/frontend/src/App.jsx)
* **Mechanism**: The user interface supports three query filters that map cleanly to targeted datasets:
  | Mode | External APIs | Local Index |
  | :--- | :--- | :--- |
  | **All** *(Default)* | Wikipedia + StackOverflow | Prose Index |
  | **Wikipedia** | Wikipedia Only | Prose Index |
  | **StackOverflow** | StackOverflow Only | Code Index |
* **Advantage**: Fine-tunes performance and output quality. Conceptual queries use Wikipedia indices, whereas technical queries target code token streams from StackOverflow.

### 4. Distributed Processing of External Results
* **Files**: `gateway/main.py`
* **Mechanism**: Real-time Wikipedia/StackOverflow responses are split into chunks and distributed asynchronously across active background worker nodes for parallel metadata enrichment and attribution.
* **Advantage**: Simulates horizontal scaling on clusters, unloading query parsing bottlenecks from the central gateway to compute nodes.

### 5. Startup Index Building
* **Files**: `main.py`
* **Mechanism**: Scans internal storage folders on node boot-up and automatically structures the code and prose inverted indexes in-memory (`build_index()`).
* **Advantage**: Replaces manual index triggers; the cluster is search-ready the moment servers boot.

### 6. Premium Responsive Light UI
* **Files**: [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/Prince%20Patel/Desktop/Projects/Disee/Disee/frontend/src/App.jsx), [index.css](file:///c:/Users/Prince%20Patel/Desktop/Projects/Disee/Disee/frontend/src/index.css), [LogoAnimation.jsx](file:///c:/Users/Prince%20Patel/Desktop/Projects/Disee/Disee/frontend/src/LogoAnimation.jsx), [MatrixBackground.jsx](file:///c:/Users/Prince%20Patel/Desktop/Projects/Disee/Disee/frontend/src/MatrixBackground.jsx)
* **Mechanism**: Features a premium light Wedgwood blue and cream theme.
  * Includes a background canvas displaying animated colliding nodes and binary streams.
  * Incorporates a `.webm` intro animation that plays dynamically on page load before cross-fading into the static brand logo.
  * Uses premium glassmorphic frosted-blur overlays behind form inputs and results.
  * Disables user-drag and selections on visual assets to preserve brand styling integrity.
