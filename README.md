A high-performance, containerized, distributed search engine built with **FastAPI** and **Docker**. This project implements a scalable architecture for indexing and searching across multiple distributed storage nodes using a centralized gateway for result aggregation and deduplication.

The project is structured around a **Gateway-Node** pattern, where a central entry point manages communication with multiple worker nodes that handle local data storage and indexing.

### Phase 1: Single Node (Single Machine)
Initial implementation focused on a standalone node managing its own inverted index and search logic.

### Phase 2: Multiple Nodes (Single Machine)
Introduction of the **Gateway Service**, which orchestrates search queries across multiple containers running on the same host via Docker Compose.

The goal of Phase 3 is to achieve full distribution across multiple physical or virtual machines, implementing more resilient discovery and load balancing.

## ✨ Key Features
=======
##  Key Features
>>>>>>> 635958b941dcf6ce383126466d0b32b1fb14d9fd

- **Distributed Query Aggregation**: The Gateway service fans out search requests to all active nodes in parallel.
- **Automated Inverted Indexing**: Each node builds and optimizes its local inverted index automatically upon system startup.
- **Result Deduplication**: Intelligent post-processing at the gateway layer to ensure unique search results.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Heavy use of `httpx` and `asyncio` for non-blocking concurrent node communication.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Fully containerized setup for consistent development and deployment.
- **FastAPI OpenAPI Integration**: Interactive API documentation available out-of-the-box.
